# Code Semantic Model Interchange v0.1

Status: **draft**.

CSMI is a semantic interchange specification for describing selected behavior
of software artifacts in a form that independently implemented analyzers can
interpret consistently.

## 1. Specification architecture

### 1.1 Layers

CSMI separates the meaning of semantic facts from their machine representation.

| Layer | Role |
| --- | --- |
| Semantic model | Analyzer-neutral concepts, their meaning, and conformance obligations. |
| Serialization | A concrete encoding of the semantic model. JSON is the first normative serialization. |
| Structural schema | The machine-readable JSON Schema that constrains a JSON document's shape. |
| Semantic conformance | Requirements that structural validation alone cannot express. |
| Pack | The distributable envelope for semantic models, provenance, and integrity metadata. |
| Transport and registry | Out of scope for v0.1. |

JSON Schema validates structure. It does not define semantic interpretation.
Conformance therefore requires both structural validation and the semantic rules
in this specification.

### 1.2 Normative language

The key words **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **REQUIRED**, **SHALL**, **SHALL NOT**,
**SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**, **RECOMMENDED**, **MAY**, and **OPTIONAL** are to be
interpreted as described in [BCP 14](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/bcp14) when,
and only when, they appear in all capitals.

### 1.3 Terminology

* **CSMI**: the analyzer-neutral semantic interchange specification.
* **Semantic model**: a set of semantic facts and claims expressed using CSMI
  concepts, independently of a particular serialization.
* **CSMI document**: a serialization of one or more semantic models together
  with the metadata required by that serialization.
* **CSMI pack**: a distributable artifact containing semantic documents plus an
  applicability, provenance, and integrity envelope.
* **JSON serialization**: the first normative mapping from the semantic model to
  JSON.
* **JSON Schema**: the structural validator for that JSON serialization.
* **Producer**: a tool that derives and emits semantic information.
* **Consumer**: a tool that reads semantic information and interprets it under
  this specification.
* **Target artifact**: the dependency, package, binary, or source artifact whose
  behavior is being described.
* **Core**: concepts that all conforming producers and consumers of a semantic
  family MUST understand or reject explicitly under the extension rules.
* **Required semantics**: semantics without which a consumer cannot interpret
  the affected model correctly. A consumer that does not support them MUST
  report the model as uninterpretable rather than silently ignore them.
* **Optional semantics**: additional semantics that a consumer MAY ignore
  without changing the meaning or completeness of the remaining model.
* **Profile**: a standard, versioned semantic vocabulary built from CSMI
  extension mechanics.
* **Extension**: a namespaced, versioned vocabulary that is not required for
  basic CSMI interpretation.

### 1.4 Repository documents

`specification.md` is the source of truth for semantic meaning and conformance.
The illustrative material in the repository README and examples is explanatory
and non-normative. For v0.1, the normative set consists of:

1. this specification;
2. `schema.json`;
3. valid and invalid structural fixtures;
4. semantic conformance fixtures.

Pack examples show complete documents rather than isolated fragments, but they
do not override the normative prose, schema, or conformance fixtures.

## 2. Versioning

### 2.1 Semantic-model version

The CSMI semantic-model version identifies the concepts, their meaning, and
consumer obligations. The 0.x series is experimental: a consumer MUST support a
0.x version explicitly and MUST NOT infer compatibility solely from a shared
major or minor version. Any change to semantics or conformance obligations
requires a new declared semantic-model version.

### 2.2 Serialization version

The JSON serialization has its own identity and evolution rule. A change to the
accepted serialized structure requires a new declared serialization version,
even when semantic interpretation is unchanged. Purely editorial changes do not
require a new declared version.

For v0.1, every document MUST identify the semantic-model version. It MUST also
carry enough serialization identity for a validator to select the corresponding
schema. The exact field placement is decided with the pack manifest design.

Supporting a serialization does not imply support for the semantic-model
version it encodes, and supporting a semantic-model version does not imply
support for every serialization of that model. Unsupported versions are an
explicit outcome, not an empty semantic model.

### 2.3 JSON Schema version

The v0.1 JSON serialization MUST use
[JSON Schema Draft 2020-12](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/), identified
by its official meta-schema URI. JSON Schema defines structural validity; the
normative prose and conformance fixtures define invariants that cannot be
expressed structurally.

### 2.4 Profiles and extensions

Profiles and extensions are independently versioned. They MUST NOT redefine or
reinterpret a core field. They MAY add a vocabulary item when the extension
mechanics permit it. A consumer MUST be able to distinguish:

* an optional extension that may be ignored;
* an extension whose absence changes completeness; and
* a required extension without which the affected facts cannot be interpreted.

## 3. Semantic-core sections

The sections below map the v0.1 workstreams. Their content is added after the
corresponding design issues are resolved.

### 3.1 Artifact and package identity

An artifact selector identifies a package or distribution and constrains the
artifacts to which a semantic model applies. Artifact identity is independent
of producer identity: changing the producer does not change the modeled
artifact, and changing the modeled artifact does not change the producer.

#### 3.1.1 Package coordinates

An artifact selector MUST contain one canonical
[Package URL (PURL)](https://ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-427/)
conforming to ECMA-427 and to the registered definition of its PURL type. A
producer MUST preserve the type-specific meaning, case rules, normalization,
and qualifiers defined by PURL; it MUST NOT apply CSMI-specific reinterpretation
to individual PURL components.

Package identity comparison MUST compare canonical PURL components rather than
raw input strings. A qualifier present in the selector is a constraint and MUST
have an equivalent value in the candidate artifact. If comparable candidate
evidence has a different value, the selector is not matched; if the candidate
does not expose that qualifier, applicability is indeterminate. Additional
candidate qualifiers do not contradict a selector that intentionally applies
more broadly.

The PURL identifies a package or distribution. It does not by itself prove that
the consumer has the same bytes the producer modeled. Consumers MUST NOT treat
different PURL type, namespace, or name components as aliases without external,
trusted equivalence evidence.

The PURL `subpath` component MUST NOT appear in a v0.1 artifact selector. CSMI
symbol and declaration identity identifies entities within the selected
artifact; using `subpath` for this purpose would create a second, ambiguous
program-entity identity mechanism.

#### 3.1.2 Exact versions and version ranges

A selector MUST use exactly one of these version forms:

- an exact version in the PURL `version` component; or
- a [VERS](https://www.packageurl.org/docs/vers/introduction) constraint whose
  scheme is applicable to the selector's PURL type.

A selector MUST NOT contain both an exact PURL version and a VERS constraint.
Free-form version ranges and non-canonical VERS strings are invalid. The VERS
type MUST equal the selector's PURL type. A producer MUST NOT compare versions
using lexical ordering, Semantic Versioning, or any other substitute for the
comparison procedure selected by VERS.

The VERS type MUST have a registered comparison procedure or a procedure fully
defined by a required CSMI profile. A range with no specified comparison
procedure is semantically invalid; merely accepting its URI syntax is not
sufficient.

A consumer that does not implement the applicable VERS scheme MUST return an
indeterminate applicability result. It MUST NOT guess whether the version is in
range.

PURL and VERS apply percent-encoding independently. When deriving a VERS
constraint from a PURL version, a producer MUST decode the PURL component once
and then encode the resulting version under VERS rules. It MUST NOT splice an
encoded PURL component directly into a VERS string.

#### 3.1.3 Artifact digests

A selector MAY contain one or more cryptographic digests of the modeled
artifact. A digest identifies exact content and is separate from the package
coordinate and version constraint.

A digest is REQUIRED when the modeled semantics depend on exact content that
the canonical PURL and version constraint do not identify unambiguously. This
includes at least:

- a locally built, patched, repackaged, or otherwise non-registry artifact;
- an ecosystem coordinate that can select multiple relevant binaries or source
  distributions without identity-bearing qualifiers sufficient to distinguish
  them; and
- semantics derived from build features, generated code, platform variants, or
  classifiers that the PURL type cannot represent completely.

A producer SHOULD include a digest whenever it has the exact artifact bytes,
even when the digest is not required. A producer MUST state what byte sequence
each digest covers, such as an archive, binary, source distribution, or image
manifest. Any coverage kind that requires canonicalization, including a source
tree, MUST identify the canonicalization procedure. A consumer MUST compare
only digests with the same algorithm, coverage kind, and canonicalization
procedure.

The v0.1 core supports the `sha-256`, `sha-384`, and `sha-512` names from the
[IANA Hash Function Textual Names registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/hash-function-text-names).
Digest values MUST use lowercase hexadecimal with the full output length of the
selected algorithm. SHA-1 MUST NOT be produced. Additional algorithms require a
profile or extension until the core set is expanded.

Digest coverage kinds within a selector are conjunctive. Multiple algorithms
for the same coverage kind are alternative ways to establish that content: at
least one comparable digest MUST match and every comparable digest MUST agree.
Any comparable mismatch makes that selector not matched. If the consumer cannot
compute any listed algorithm for a required coverage kind, or lacks the covered
bytes, applicability is indeterminate.

#### 3.1.4 Alternatives and constraint composition

A semantic model MAY declare multiple artifact selectors. Selectors are
alternatives: the model is applicable if any selector matches. Within one
selector, the package coordinate, version constraint, PURL qualifiers, and all
required digest evidence are conjunctive and MUST all be satisfied.

Producers SHOULD use multiple selectors only when the same semantic claims and
completeness claims apply to every alternative. If behavior or completeness
differs by artifact version or variant, the producer MUST use separate semantic
models or separately scoped claims rather than a broader selector.

#### 3.1.5 Applicability outcomes

Matching one selector produces exactly one of these outcomes:

**matched**
: Every required constraint has comparable evidence and is satisfied.

**not matched**
: At least one required constraint has comparable evidence and is contradicted.

**indeterminate**
: No required constraint is contradicted, but evidence or comparison support
  needed to establish a match is unavailable.

For multiple alternative selectors, a single `matched` result makes the model
applicable. Otherwise, the combined result is `indeterminate` if any selector is
indeterminate, and `not matched` only if every selector is not matched.

An indeterminate result MUST NOT be treated as matched or not matched. A default
consumer MUST fail closed and decline to apply the model. A consumer MAY expose
an explicit trust policy that permits an operator to override this behavior,
but the reported applicability result remains indeterminate and the override
MUST be observable.

#### 3.1.6 Matching procedure

For each selector, a consumer MUST:

1. parse and validate the PURL under ECMA-427 and its registered type;
2. reject a selector containing `subpath`, both version forms, or neither an
   exact version nor a VERS constraint;
3. compare canonical package identity and selector qualifiers using the PURL
   type's equivalence rules;
4. compare the exact version or evaluate VERS using the applicable ecosystem
   procedure;
5. compare every required artifact digest for which comparable bytes and an
   algorithm implementation are available; and
6. combine the evidence using the outcomes in section 3.1.5.

A malformed selector is semantically invalid, not indeterminate. A valid
selector with insufficient evidence is indeterminate.

#### 3.1.7 Compatibility constraints

Runtime, toolchain, ABI, language edition, operating system, and hardware
constraints that select a distinct package artifact SHOULD use identity-bearing
qualifiers defined by the applicable PURL type. Compatibility constraints that
describe where already-selected artifact semantics hold, rather than which
artifact is selected, are a separate CSMI concept and MUST NOT be encoded as
invented PURL qualifiers.

Compatibility constraints MUST be declared separately from artifact selectors
and evaluated only after artifact applicability. A profile defining a
compatibility constraint MUST define its namespace, version, value syntax,
comparison procedure, and composition rules. CSMI 0.1 does not define a
universal toolchain or runtime version scheme.

Compatibility evaluation produces `compatible`, `incompatible`, or
`indeterminate`. A consumer that cannot interpret a required compatibility
profile MUST report the model as uninterpretable. A consumer that understands
the profile but lacks comparison evidence MUST report compatibility as
indeterminate. Both outcomes fail closed by default and neither changes the
artifact applicability result.

### 3.2 Symbol identity

Defines an analyzer-neutral reference contract for declarations, callables,
fields, parameters, and related program entities.

### 3.3 Declarations

Defines the optional declaration facts needed to resolve and interpret semantic
summaries without requiring a universal type system or source AST.

### 3.4 Procedure summaries

Defines procedure ports, locations, directional transfers, and the minimum
semantics that two analyzers can implement consistently.

### 3.5 Completeness and uncertainty

Defines fact-family completeness and the difference between absence of evidence
and evidence of absence.

### 3.6 Effects, profiles, and extensions

Defines the optional effect vocabulary and the namespacing, versioning, and
unknown-vocabulary rules.

### 3.7 Manifest, provenance, and canonicalization

Defines the pack envelope, its applicability and provenance claims, integrity
mechanism, and deterministic representation requirements.

## 4. Conformance

Conformance has four independent dimensions:

| Dimension | Question |
| --- | --- |
| Structural validity | Does the document conform to the declared serialization schema? |
| Semantic validity | Do its references and semantic claims satisfy the specification's invariants? |
| Applicability | Does it match the exact artifact and variant under analysis? |
| Interpretability | Does the consumer support all semantics required to interpret it correctly? |

A successful result in one dimension MUST NOT be reported as proof of another.
In particular, structurally valid JSON is not necessarily semantically valid,
applicable, or interpretable.

### 4.1 Structural conformance

A conforming JSON document MUST validate against the normative schema selected
by its version. The schema MUST reject unknown core object fields using JSON
Schema's closed-object facilities.

### 4.2 Semantic conformance

A conforming implementation MUST preserve the meaning defined by this
specification. In particular:

* a missing fact MUST NOT imply that behavior is absent;
* incompleteness MUST remain distinguishable from an explicit negative claim;
* unknown optional extensions MUST NOT silently change core semantics; and
* producers MUST be distinguishable from the artifact whose semantics they
  describe.

### 4.3 Independence requirement

Two independently implemented consumers MUST be able to assign the same meaning
to a core CSMI fact without using producer source code, producer internal
serialization, hidden side channels, or analyzer-specific name parsing.

### 4.4 Inconclusive and unsupported outcomes

A consumer MUST NOT collapse malformed input, semantic invalidity,
inapplicability, an unsupported version, unsupported required semantics, or
incomplete coverage into a model with no facts. Each condition MUST remain
distinguishable from a complete claim that modeled behavior is absent.

## 5. Open design decisions

These decisions MUST be resolved before v0.1 becomes candidate-complete. The
initial draft positions are review proposals, not final normative choices.

| Decision | Initial draft position | Linked issue |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Symbol representation | Define a structured analyzer-neutral contract rather than requiring consumers to parse language-specific fully qualified names. | #3 |
| Existing symbol schemes | Reuse established concepts where practical, but do not adopt another grammar wholesale without resolving ownership and extensibility. | #3 |
| Declaration scope | Include only resolution-bearing facts required by summaries; keep complete language type systems out of core. | #4 |
| Transfer meaning | Treat a transfer as directional may-flow unless a separately defined relation kind proves necessary. | #5 |
| Completeness scope | Define completeness independently for each fact family rather than as a single pack-wide flag. | #6 |
| Core effects | Keep only broadly portable effect concepts in core; express specialized domains as versioned profiles. | #7 |
| Extension requirement | Make required extensions explicit so consumers can fail closed for affected facts instead of ignoring them. | #7 |
| Canonicalization | Prefer deterministic producer requirements and a defined content address; defer broad canonical JSON policy only if it is unnecessary for integrity. | #8 |
| Distribution | Exclude transport and registry protocols from v0.1. | #8 |
